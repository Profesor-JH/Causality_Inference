 Judea Pearl and his research group have developed in the last decades a solid theoretical framework to deal with a common frustration in the industry in orders to
be able to answer question such as “Which clients will pay their debts only if I call them?” , but the first steps toward merging it with mainstream machine learning are
just beginning. The causal graph is a central object in the framework mentioned above, but it is often unknown, subject to personal knowledge and bias, or loosely
connected to the available data.

The main objectif is to conduct an exploratory data analysis on the data &amp; communicate useful insights.
