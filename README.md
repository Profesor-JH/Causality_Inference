## Introduction
 Judea Pearl and his research group have developed in the last decades a solid theoretical framework to deal with a common frustration in the industry in orders to
be able to answer question such as “Which clients will pay their debts only if I call them?” , but the first steps toward merging it with mainstream machine learning are
just beginning. The causal graph is a central object in the framework mentioned above, but it is often unknown, subject to personal knowledge and bias, or loosely
connected to the available data.

The main objectif is to conduct an exploratory data analysis on the data &amp; communicate useful insights.

## Intallation of package
``` 
$ git clone 
$cd Causality-Challange
$ pip install -r requriements.txt

 ### data :\
 This folderr contains all the dataset used and obtainined using the process of data preprocessing and feacture extraction.
 You can extract the data from[ kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data).
 Features in the data are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
Attribute Information:
- ID number
- Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) \
 The remaining (3-32) . Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus: radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
- texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
- Perimeter
- Area
- smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
- compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
- concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
- concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
- Symmetry
- fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
